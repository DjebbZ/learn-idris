{- 1.
What are the types of the following values?
("A", "B", "C")
["A", "B", "C"]
(('A', "B"), 'C')
You can check your answers with :t at the REPL, but try to work them out yourself first.


("A", "B", "C") : (String, String, String)
["A", "B", "C"] : List String
(('A', "B"), 'C') : ((Char, String,), Char)
-}


{- 2.
Write a palindrome function, of type String -> Bool, that returns whether the input reads the same backwards as forwards.
Hint: You may find the function reverse : String -> String useful.
You can test your answer at the REPL as follows:

*ex_2> palindrome "racecar"
True : Bool

*ex_2> palindrome "race car"
False : Bool
-}

palindrome : String -> Bool
palindrome str = str == reverse str

{- 3.
Modify the palindrome function so that itâ€™s not case sensitive.
Hint: You may find toLower : String -> String useful. You can test your answer at the REPL as follows:
*ex_2> palindrome "Racecar"
True : Bool
-}

palindrome_i : String -> Bool
palindrome_i str = palindrome (toLower str)

{- 4.
Modify the palindrome function so that it only returns True for strings longer than 10 characters.
You can test your answer at the REPL as follows:
*ex_2> palindrome "racecar"
False : Bool

*ex_2> palindrome "able was i ere i saw elba"
True : Bool
-}

palindrome10 : String -> Bool
palindrome10 str = if length str <= 10
                    then False
                    else palindrome_i str

{- 5.
Modify the palindrome function so that it only returns True for strings longer than some length given as an argument.
Hint: Your new function should have type Nat -> String -> Bool.
You can test your answer at the REPL as follows:
*ex_2> palindrome 10 "racecar"
False : Bool

*ex_2> palindrome 5 "racecar"
True : Bool
-}

palindrome_n : Nat -> String -> Bool
palindrome_n x str = if length str <= x
                      then False
                      else palindrome_i str

{- 6.
Write a counts function of type String -> (Nat, Nat) that returns a pair of the number of words in the input and the number of characters in the input.
You can test your answer at the REPL as follows:
*ex_2> counts "Hello, Idris world!"
(3, 19) : (Nat, Nat)
-}

counts : String -> (Nat, Nat)
counts str = let
              nbWords = wordCount str
              nbChars = length str
             in
              (nbWords, nbChars)
             where
              wordCount : String -> Nat
              wordCount str = length (words str)

{- 7.
Write a top_ten function of type Ord a => List a -> List a that returns the ten largest values in a list.
You may find the following Prelude functions useful:
take : Nat -> List a -> List a
sort : Ord a => List a -> List a
Use :doc for further information about these functions if you need it. You can test your answer at the REPL as follows:
*ex_2> top_ten [1..100]
[100, 99, 98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 91] : List Integer
-}

top_ten : Ord a => List a -> List a
top_ten l = take 10 (reverse (sort l))

{- 8.
Write an over_length function of type Nat -> List String -> Nat that returns the number of strings in the list longer than the given number of characters.
You can test your answer at the REPL as follows:
*ex_2> over_length 3 ["One", "Two", "Three", "Four"]
2 : Nat
-}

over_length : Nat -> List String -> Nat
over_length x l = length (filter (\el => length el > x) l)
